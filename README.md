# MIT_project_final
In this project, I 1) created a novel token, 2) deployed an NFT onto blockchain, and 3) created an NFT marketplace.

token issurance folder for the novel FITMAN2 token issurance Solidity code, which was deployed in Remix.

NFT issurance folder for deploying an NFT onto blockchain. The image of the NFT was saved in Pinata. This can be deployed in my local environment using npm.

Marketplace folder for an NFT marketplace. This can be deployed in my local environment using npm.

I put much effort in this project while enjoyed a lot. Thanks!
